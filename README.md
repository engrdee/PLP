#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software systematically. It ensures high-quality software that meets user needs.
Importance:
Drives innovation in technology.
Ensures scalability and reliability of software.
development costs and time through structured processes.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Creation of FORTRAN (1957): First high-level programming language, simplifying programming.
Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s): Improved code readability and modular design.
Agile Manifesto (2001): Revolutionized software development with adaptive and iterative methodologies.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Requirements Gathering: Identify user and system needs.
Design: Create architecture and system design.
Development: Write and implement code.
Testing: Verify software functionality and quality.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Address bugs and updates post-release

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Sequential process (e.g., planning, then design). Ideal for fixed-scope projects like government contracts.


Agile: Iterative approach with regular feedback. Suitable for dynamic projects like app development.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Write, debug, and maintain code.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Test software for defects and ensure quality.
Project Manager: Plan, coordinate, and oversee project progress.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code): Streamline development with features like debugging and syntax highlighting.
VCS (e.g., Git): Tracks changes, facilitates collaboration, and prevents data loss.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Use Agile to adapt quickly.
Tight Deadlines: Employ task prioritization and time management tools.
Team Collaboration: Utilize communication tools like Slack.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Test individual components (ensures functionality).
Integration Testing: Test interactions between components (ensures compatibility).
System Testing: Test the entire system (validates overall functionality).
Acceptance Testing: Test by end-users (ensures software meets requirements).


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective input prompts to guide AI models, like ChatGPT, in generating precise, relevant, and high-quality outputs. It involves structuring prompts to clearly communicate the task or information required, leveraging the model's capabilities to their fullest.
Importance of Prompt Engineering
Enhances Output Quality: Well-designed prompts lead to accurate and relevant responses.
Maximizes Efficiency: Reduces back-and-forth iterations by clearly defining expectations.
Tailors AI Behavior: Directs the model to align its output with specific contexts, audiences, or requirements.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
Issues with the Vague Prompt:
Too broad: Doesn't specify a time period, region, or topic.
Lacks clarity: The model might provide generic or unrelated information.
Improved Prompt
Improved Prompt: "Provide a brief summary of World War II, focusing on the causes, major events, and outcomes."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
Clarity: Clearly defines the topic (World War II).
Specificity: Outlines key areas to cover (causes, events, outcomes).
Conciseness: Uses precise language without ambiguity.
The improved prompt ensures the model generates a focused and detailed response, aligning with the user's intent while saving time and effort.
